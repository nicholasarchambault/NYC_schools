# Analyzing SAT Scores, Race and Geography in NYC Schools
by Nicholas Archambault

The SAT is a standardized test taken by thousands of high school students annually as they apply to college. Controversy surrounding the test centers on how performance tends to be uneven across socioeconomic and demographic groups. This project examines the SAT performance of New York City schools and the relationships between performance and race, as well as school safety and geography.

## Goals
1. Filter and merge seven datasets of demographic, educational, and logistical information on NYC schools and their student populations.
2. Create exploratory plots of relationship between SAT score and school safety, as well as correlations between SAT performance and race, general scholastic performance, and gender.
3. Use 'Basemap' package to visualize school safety by geography and the distribution of high schools across New York City boroughs.

## Output
A unified dataset of information on student demographics, graduation outcomes, test performance, and survey responses for all NYC schools. A better understanding of how geography, school safety, and race relate to SAT performance.
